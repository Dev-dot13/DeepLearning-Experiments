## üìò Group A: Core Experiments

### ‚úÖ **1. Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**
**Objective:**  
Build and train a **feedforward neural network from scratch** using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or Keras.

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Multiclass Classification using Deep Neural Networks**
**Example Dataset:**  
OCR Letter Recognition Dataset

**Objective:**  
Develop a deep learning model that performs **multiclass classification** using a fully connected neural network.

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Binary Classification of Movie Reviews**
**Dataset Used:** IMDB Movie Reviews

**Objective:**  
Classify movie reviews as **"positive"** or **"negative"**, based solely on the **text content** using a DNN model.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
**Objective:**  
Develop a CNN-based system to recognize and classify **handwritten digits** from image data.

## üìò Group B: Elective Experiments (Any 3)

### ‚úÖ **6. Sentiment Analysis using RNN**
**Objective:**  
Create an RNN-based model for **sentiment classification** of text reviews (movie or product).  
The model classifies text into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** categories using labeled datasets.

---

### ‚úÖ **7. Transfer Learning with Pretrained Models**
**Models Used:** VGG, ResNet, Inception

**Objective:**
